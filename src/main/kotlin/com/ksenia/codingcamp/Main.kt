            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and coat a small 4 x 6 or 6 x 6 loaf pan with cooking spray and set aside- A smaller pan yields thicker brownies.

            Transfer brownie batter to loaf pan and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until a skewer comes out just clean. 
            Allow the brownies to cool in the pan completely before frosting. Brownies need to kept refrigerated for the best texture.
